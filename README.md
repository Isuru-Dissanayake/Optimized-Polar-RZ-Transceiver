# Optimized-Polar-Return-to-Zero-Line-coding-Transceiver

### Why not just 'polar return-to zero' ?

Here we have implemented a polar return-to-zero line coding transceiver which is optimized using a clock delay. The ordinary polar return zero line encoding technique can be graphically visualize as follows,
