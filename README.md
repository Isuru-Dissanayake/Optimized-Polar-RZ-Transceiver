# Optimized-Polar-Return-to-Zero-Line-coding-Transceiver

### Why not just 'polar return-to zero' ?

Here we have implemented a polar return-to-zero line coding transceiver which is optimized using a clock delay. The ordinary polar return zero line encoding technique can be graphically visualize as follows,

To encode the data signal into this polar return to zero signal, the usual way is to have the clock frequency doubled the frequency of the data signal. This data signal and clock signal are initially synchronized as follows, and that synchronized signals are sent through the encoder circuit to obtain the encoded signal.
