There are circuit elements that we have identified in encoder and decoder circuits. 

- Comparators
- Invertors
- AND gates
- Adders

The way that we have implemented these circuits is by using analog electronic components such as transistors, resistors, capacitors etc.

### Comparator 

Comaparator is used to compare the digital signal with a reference voltage. For that we use a opamp ic. If the reference voltage is given to the positive input and the signal is given to the negetive input, the output wave form is inverted.
